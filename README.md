# game_of_life

This is a spare time project I wanted to do after joining the global day of code retreat 2019.
<br>
The goal is to write a sample solution of Conway's Game of Life the way I would write it right now. I will do it using test driven developement starting with a Python version and maybe adding solutions in other languages later on.
<br>
With this I want to improve my testing skills, Python unittest knowledge and develop a small project using TDD since I have never done a project with this method.
